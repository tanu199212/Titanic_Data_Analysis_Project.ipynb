Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data sets. It involves checking data for completeness, removing duplicate entries, dealing with missing data, standardizing data formats, and correcting data values that are out of range or invalid.

Importance of Data Cleaning
Accurate data is essential for making informed decisions: If the data is incorrect, any insights or conclusions drawn from it may be flawed.
Data cleaning can help identify and prevent errors early on: This can save time and resources by avoiding costly mistakes downstream.
ata cleaning can improve the quality of data: By removing errors and inconsistencies, data becomes more reliable and trustworthy.
Data cleaning can improve the efficiency of data analysis: With clean data, analysts can spend more time analysing data and less time correcting errors.
